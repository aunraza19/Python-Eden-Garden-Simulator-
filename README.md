## Python-Eden-Garden-Simulator-
Python Eden Garden Simulator is a Python-based simulation that models the growth stages of plants. It allows users to track plant development, determine when plants are harvestable, and simulate agricultural cycles programmatically.

# Features

Simulates plant growth through different stages (seed, sprout, mature, flower, fruit, harvest ready).

Tracks harvest readiness of plants.

Supports multiple plant objects with unique characteristics.

Allows harvesting when a plant reaches the final stage.

Provides a simple and interactive way to model plant growth cycles.

Customizable plant types with varying yield amounts.

# Python Functionalities Used

GardenSim leverages several core Python functionalities to simulate plant growth and harvesting:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project uses classes and objects to model plants, their attributes, and behaviors.

Instance Variables and Methods: Each plant has attributes such as name, growth_stage, and yield_amount, with methods like grow() and harvest() to modify them.

Control Flow (Loops & Conditionals): Growth simulation relies on loops and conditional statements to track and change plant states.

Encapsulation: Data attributes like current_stage and harvestable are managed internally to ensure logical plant growth progression.

List & Dictionary Handling: Stores plant growth stages and yield amounts in structured formats for efficient data retrieval.

Formatted Strings: Used to provide meaningful output messages during the simulation.
